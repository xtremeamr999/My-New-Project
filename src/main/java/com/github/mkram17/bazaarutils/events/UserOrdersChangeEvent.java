/**
 * Event fired when the user's bazaar orders list changes.
 * <p>
 * This event is triggered whenever a bazaar order is added, removed, or updated in the user's
 * tracked orders list. It allows listeners to react to changes in the player's active orders.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @EventHandler
 * public void onOrderChange(UserOrdersChangeEvent event) {
 *     switch (event.getChangeType()) {
 *         case ADD -> handleNewOrder(event.getOrder());
 *         case REMOVE -> handleRemovedOrder(event.getOrder());
 *         case UPDATE -> handleUpdatedOrder(event.getOrder());
