/**
 * Event fired when a bazaar order is outbid or becomes competitive again.
 * <p>
 * This event is triggered when the player's order in the bazaar is no longer the best offer (outbid)
 * or when it becomes competitive again. This allows the mod to notify the player about their order status.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @EventHandler
 * public void onOutbid(OutbidOrderEvent event) {
 *     if (event.isOutbid()) {
 *         // Notify player that their order was outbid
 *         notifyPlayer("Your order for " + event.getOrder().getName() + " was outbid!");
 *     }
